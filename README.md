# igv.js in React
This is a minimal example of integrating the [igv.js](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js) genome browser with the popular [React](https://reactjs.org/) framework for front-end web development.  The project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app), and made possible by [implementing ES6 export in igv.js](https://github.com/igvteam/igv.js/issues/674).
